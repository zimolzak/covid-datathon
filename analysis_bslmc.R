# (1) Understand Rory's process; Plus Explore the .tab files & understand.
# Analyses according to thoughts.pdf. What's feasible.
# Very good that Rory mapped adt_pat_class_c to pat_class and also kept both.

## took lab for covid
## find all pts who had those lab
## randomice
## took first 150 pat ids
## ran those pat ids over whole hosp record

# never been done - TODO -->
# 	6.	inpatient: testing late in admission: rate of this, rate of positives. â€¨# cool to have ER data

# what is "outpatient"
# still is really outpatient, outpatient test xray us etc. monitoring etc.
# endoscopy, outpat cath, outpat ed.

# Next pull:
# hosp admission disch dx
# pulse ox
# maaaaybe the order date vs result date
# totally okay to NOT join admissions with the problem list

# where will datathon people get their data dictionaries (Gloria has it: need just a BCM ECA to log in)
